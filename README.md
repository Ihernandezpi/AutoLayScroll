How to use Autolayout with UIScrollView programmatically?

When I wanted to use Autolayout on a UIScrollView object, I had the following issue:
Even though the components would be nicely laid out inside the contentView, I did not know how to end up with the proper height for the contentSize, other that by trying out a value on my own.

Searching the net for that problem would lead me to solutions, but all meant for people using storyboard, not for folks doing it programmatically.
I had to translate the info I could find to my case, and make it work as I wanted (that is programmatically).

This project shows how to do this. It is certainly not the only way, but it works for me.
I hope it will be useful to someone else hitting the same question in the future.
